# CARMA
# This folder contains the code to run CARMA (R)

The CARMA code is taken from "DNA copy number motifs are strong and independent predictors of survival in breast cancer" by Arne Pladsen et al. (2020). (https://github.com/arnevpladsen/CARMA)

There is also code to run CAAI (Chromosome Arm Abberation Index), CINdex (degree of amplifications and deletions), and GII (Genomic Instability Index).

The input for all these code come from ASCAT output; there are five columns chromosome (chr), start position (startpos), end position (endpos), nMajor, and nMinor.
